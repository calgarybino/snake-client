Snake Client Project

The Snake Client Project is a multiplayer take on the popular snake game concept. In this game, players maneuver a dot and grow it by eating pieces of food. As the snake moves and eats, it grows, and the growing snake becomes an obstacle to smooth maneuvers. The goal is to grow the snake as big as possible without bumping into the side walls or itself, as doing so will result in the snake's demise.

Before running this client, ensure that you have the server-side up and running.
